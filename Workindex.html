          <h2>User Acceptance Tester</h2>
          <p>I worked with the web development team to find bugs and test the company site.
            Using Jira I reported my findings and moved tickets from staging to development. 
            Our team used a SCRUM approch to develop. I particpated in daily stand ups, 
            sprints and sprint planning meetings. I would say this agile methood was highly efficient 
            because we find could continusly improve the site and make sure everything was 
            functioning correctly.

          <h2>Digital Marketing Specialist</h2>
          <p>My time as was spent working with agencies and deploying different markting materals.
            These efforts were to increase traffic to the company website. Certain metrics could be used to track 
          engagement and conversations. I used SQL to find specific attribution data and Google data Studio to 
          build dashboards. During this time I increased my knowledge in SEO, PPC and email marketing.  </p>
