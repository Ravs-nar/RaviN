        <p>I am a digital markter who has made the leap into web development. Although the jobs are different,
          They both seek to acomplish similer goals. Make the site more engaging and useable. With the end goal
          of bringing more users to the site. Making the transition has been a fun process full of learning.</p>
          <p>I enjoy listening to music and learning how to play the piano and ukulele. Mrtial arts are another
            passion of mine. My favorites are Jiu-Jitsu and boxing. But, I love to learn all kinds such as MuayThai
            and wresling.
